The eProcurement Ontology, as developed by the Publications Office of the EU,
is a foundational work for shaping the eProcurement landscape across the EU,
especially so as key components (eForms, ESPD, eCertis, ...) are continuously
improved and harmonised. Whilst the Ontology per se is a very comprehensive
effort, there appears to be a missing link as far as new data architecture
initiatives (notably the Data Strategy, the European Blockchain Services
Infrastructure and GAIA-X) are concerned. Liasing with such initiatives, at the
governance, semantic and data architecture levels, is of the utmost importance
to create a rich and effective data ecosystem. We will examine governance and
technical aspects of such liasing, with a special focus on the European
Blockchain Services Infrastructure.
