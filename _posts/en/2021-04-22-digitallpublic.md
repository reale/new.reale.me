The DigitALL Public conference is the closing event of the Connecting Europe
Facility (CEF) Digital and the Interoperability solutions for public
administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA²) programmes. Together with the
Member States, these programmes have helped build cross-border public services
for citizens, provided free interoperable solutions to companies and connected
various organisations in different sectors. The DigitALL Public conference will
celebrate the next step in this journey while looking ahead towards Europe's
digital future.

I am proud to have represented the Italian governement and [Agenzia per
l'Italia
Digitale](https://www.linkedin.com/company/agenzia-italia-digitale/) at the
closing conference of the CEF and ISA² programmes: an ideal moment to assess
how well we are faring in the digital transformation of public services across
the EU and to celebrate the beginning of the new Digital Europe Programme.

The reason for Italy to promote the development of the EU-wide analytics
framework for public procurement which was presented at the workshop today is
basically twofold.

The first reason is that we need to track national KPIs in a very diverse and
complex ecosystem comprising one national central purchasing body (CPB), 20
regional CPBs, around 20,000 contracting authorities and 150,000 SMEs. This
requires well-developed monitoring and control capabilities.

The second reason reaches much deeper, and is linked to what Ursula von der
Leyen declared at the State of Union 2020. As the EU, we cannot afford not to
learn how to leverage data both as an asset and as a way to design and build
sound public policies. And this is true, first and foremost, in public
procurement, and requires powerful analytic tools in order to measure
transparency and efficiency of public expenditure.
