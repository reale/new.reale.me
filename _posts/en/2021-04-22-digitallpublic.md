The DigitALL Public conference is the closing event of the Connecting Europe
Facility (CEF) Digital and the Interoperability solutions for public
administrations, businesses and citizens (ISA²) programmes. Together with the
Member States, these programmes have helped build cross-border public services
for citizens, provided free interoperable solutions to companies and connected
various organisations in different sectors. The DigitALL Public conference will
celebrate the next step in this journey while looking ahead towards Europe's
digital future.
