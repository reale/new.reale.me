In this thesis we introduce the fundamental concepts of the geometric measure theory: a discipline that on the one hand represents a source of interesting problems per se, such as those concerning minimal surfaces, and on the other it is one of the most powerful tools of which mathematical analysis has today. The applications in fact range from the calculation of variations to the theory of partial differential equations.
